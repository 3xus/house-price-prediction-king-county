# Predictive Modeling of House Prices in King County

This project predicts house prices in King County, USA, using machine learning. The dataset includes features like bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. The goal is to identify key factors influencing prices and build a predictive model to estimate house values.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains house sale records for King County. It has multiple features such as:
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Square footage
- Year built
- Location (latitude and longitude)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and ensure data consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize relationships between features and the target variable (price).
3. **Feature Engineering**: Apply transformations and create new features to improve model performance.
4. **Modeling**: Apply different models including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Ridge Regression
   - Polynomial Transformations
5. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like RÂ² to evaluate model performance.
